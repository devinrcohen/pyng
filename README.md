# Pyng Spice - Python ngspice API
## Introduction
Pyng Spice is an API for SPICE simulation in Python, geared toward WCCA engineers who wish to do easy statistical analysis for analog circuit design. It uses pybind11 to provide access to the ngspice shared library, an open-source SPICE simulator.

## Features
* Monte carlo analog circuit simulation
* Curve plotting in the frequency domain
* Sensitivity Analysis

## Requirements
* ngspice shared lirary
* python3
* pybind11 C++ / Python interopability
* cmake
* clang C/C++ compiler
